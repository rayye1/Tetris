# Tetris
The basic outline of the code is thanks to https://github.com/kubowania by watching her tutorial on youtube

Some changes that I plan on adding/have added to this project in order to make it my own

-Formatting the display so it looks more retro. This includes modifying the button to switch colors with hover and
changing the fonts. (done)

-Used the letter P to pause/start the game (done)

-Add backwards L and backwards Z to the game 

-Add a restart button 

-Fix odd rotation bug when tetromino is on the edges
