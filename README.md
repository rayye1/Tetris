# Tetris
The basic outline of the code is thanks to https://github.com/kubowania by watching her tutorial on youtube 

Changes that I've made to that code:

-Design change such as font, color, location of different components

-Adding functionality to the P key in order to pause/start the game

-Add backwards L and backwards Z to the game 

-Fixed bug where shapes would still rotate on the screen after game is over
